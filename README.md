In our Node.js application, we use various modules such as Express for handling HTTP requests, Firebase Admin for database interactions, bcrypt for password hashing, and Axios for making HTTP requests to external APIs.We define routes for different pages of our application - the root page, sign-up page, and login page. When a user navigates to these pages, our server sends back HTML templates for rendering on the client side.We want to keep track of whether a user is logged in or not. For that, we use the express-session middleware. This allows us to create and manage sessions for each user, storing their authentication status securely.When a user logs in, they're directed to the dashboard page. Here, they have the option to search for weather information for a specific city. We make use of the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's input.We specify the port number for our server to listen on, and then we start the server. Once it's up and running, our application can handle incoming HTTP requests from clients, serving them the appropriate responses. This code addresses all key requirements, including using the POST method for sign-in and sign-up, implementing password hashing with bcrypt, preventing email duplication, and setting up a session-based authentication mechanism.
